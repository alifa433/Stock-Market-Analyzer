# Stock Market Analyzer

#### Video Demo: [URL HERE]
#### Description:
This project, titled "Stock Market Analyzer," is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for analyzing stock market trends and data. The project is built using Python and leverages various libraries such as `requests` for fetching data, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `matplotlib` for data visualization.

## Files and Functionality
- `main.py`: This is the entry point of the application. It handles user inputs and integrates different components of the project.
- `data_fetcher.py`: Responsible for fetching stock data from an external API. It ensures that the data is retrieved and formatted correctly.
- `data_processor.py`: Contains functions for processing the stock data, such as calculating moving averages or other statistical measures.
- `visualizer.py`: Handles the visualization of data. It uses `matplotlib` to create graphs and charts that represent the stock data effectively.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python libraries that are required for this project.

## Design Choices
One of the key design choices made in this project was to modularize the code into different files based on functionality. This not only makes the code more maintainable but also easier to understand and debug.

Another important decision was the choice of libraries. `Pandas` was chosen for its powerful data manipulation capabilities, and `matplotlib` was selected for its simplicity and effectiveness in data visualization.

## Challenges and Learnings
Throughout the development of this project, one of the main challenges faced was handling the inconsistencies in the data received from the API. This was addressed by implementing robust error handling and data validation mechanisms.

Another learning experience was optimizing the data visualization for clarity and effectiveness. Experimenting with different types of plots and customization options in `matplotlib` was both challenging and rewarding.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful tool for anyone interested in the stock market. Whether you are a seasoned investor or just starting, "Stock Market Analyzer" offers valuable insights into stock market trends and patterns.
